# MLP-for-CIFAR-10
Train a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model on the CIFAR-10 dataset, containing 60,000 32x32 color images distributed among 10 classes, including airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. Each image has three color channels (Red, Green, Blue), totaling 3x32x32 = 3072 pixels. The dataset comprises 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. The model architecture involves two hidden layers with ReLU activations, featuring 256 nodes in the first hidden layer and 128 nodes in the second. Dropout layers are applied to the outputs of each hidden layer with a dropout rate of 30%, and an L2 regularizer with a coefficient of Î» = 0.0001 is utilized. The evaluation of this trained model on the test data involves computing a confusion matrix. Visualization of this confusion matrix is accomplished using seaborn or a similar Python package to generate a heatmap, providing insights into the model's performance across the different classes.
